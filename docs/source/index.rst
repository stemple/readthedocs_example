   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to tychosdocs's documentation!
======================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:



Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`


Test
====

.. note::
   
   Setting ``collapse_navigation`` to False and using a high ``navigation_depth``
   can cause projects with many files and a deep file structure to generate HTML files
   that are significantly larger in file size and much longer compilation times.
